body: "NovaTerra uses Good Loop to place advertisements on our site in order to complete our goal of raising 50,000 pounds to combat environmental degradation and climate change by 2020. However, as you may have noticed, Good Loop ads aren't any ordinary ads. Instead, Good loop ads are very short videos that you must watch in full in order to donate to a charity of your choice as well as to NovaTerra. After those 15 seconds, you will be given the choice of donating to one of many charities. 50% of all earnings made from the advertisement will be donated to that same charity, 40% to NovaTerra and 10% to Good Loop. Of the 40% of the earnings that goes to NovaTerra, we donate 90% of that to charities working to combat climate change and environmental degradation. With some quick calculations you will find that in all, 86% of all earnings made from the ad goes towards charities. \n \n If you wish to learn more about how Good Loop works, click here (https://www.good-loop.com/how-it-works). \n \n How many times you wish to look at the ads is up to you, but we would encourage you to not over-watch in order to donate, as this could end our partnership with Good Loop. Although if you watch one 15 second-video per story you should be fine, as I said before, how often you decide to watch these advertisements is completely up to you. \n \n If you have any other questions about how Good Loop works, please don't hesitate in contacting us or contacting Good Loop is you wish to. \n \n Hope this helps, \n \n Oliver from NovaTerra",

For this reason, we have not relied on paid subscriptions or donations from our users to keep our site running. We have opted for a relatively new advertising service called Good Loop. Good Loop produces ads that don't distract from the content, produce higher earnings, but most importantly allow us to get closer to completing our goal of raising 50,000 pounds by 2020. 90% of all revenue generated from these ads on NovaTerra goes towards achieving this goal. \n \n You will find Good Loop ads below the title as well as another just below the comment section of each story. You will not find any other advertisement on any other page. \n \n If you would like to learn more about Good Loop and how it works click here. \n \n If you have any other questions about Good Loop, please don't hesitate in contacting us or contacting Good Loop. \n \n Hope this helps, \n \n Oliver from NovaTerra",

In order to combat these environmental issues, NovaTerra has set the goal of donating 50,000 pounds by 2020 for charities focused on these issues. \n \n NovaTerra has decided that we will not work with paid subscriptions as we want our content to be available to everyone. We have opted for ads 15-second video ads by Good Loop on the left-hand side of our stories. \n \n Because of the fact that NovaTerra is a non-profit platform, we cannot pay our users for the stories they publish.

What this means is that you can both profit and contribute to a change with your stories. \n \n NovaTerra more than an organisation is a community, where we all work together to drive change, pushing ourselves to new limits to fight this crisis that seems to be affecting all aspects of our lives. Join the NovaTerra community and together we can make sure climate change and other environmental issues are put to a halt once and for all. \n \n If you have any other questions about NovaTerra or anything else you may need help with, please don't hesitate in contacting us. \n \n Hope this helps, \n \n Oliver from NovaTerra",
