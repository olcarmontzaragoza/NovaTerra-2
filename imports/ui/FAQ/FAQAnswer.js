NovaTerra uses Good Loop to place advertisements on our site in order to complete our goal of raising 50,000 pounds to combat environmental degradation and climate change by 2020. However, as you may have noticed, Good Loop ads aren't any ordinary ads. Instead, Good loop ads are very short videos that you must watch in full in order to donate to a charity of your choice as well as to NovaTerra. After those 15 seconds, you will be given the choice of donating to one of many charities.
<br/><br/>
50% of all earnings made from the advertisement will be donated to that same charity, 40% to NovaTerra and 10% to Good Loop. Of the 40% of the earnings that goes to NovaTerra, we donate 90% of that to charities working to combat climate change and environmental degradation. With some quick calculations you will find that in all, 86% of all earnings made from the ad goes towards charities.
<br/> <br/>
If you wish to learn more about how Good Loop works, <a className="link" href="https://www.good-loop.com/how-it-works">click here</a>.
<br/> <br/>
How many times you wish to look at the ads is up to you, but we would encourage you to not over-watch in order to donate, as this could end our partnership with Good Loop. Although if you watch one 15 second-video per story you should be fine, but as I said before, how often you decide to watch these advertisements is completely up to you.
<br/><br/>

Unfortunately, NovaTerra has not yet established a way for advertisers to apply to advertise on our site. We have partnered with <a href="https://www.good-loop.com/" className="link">Good Loop</a>, a startup working to help websites and content creators make a difference by donating ad revenue. With Good Loop, we aren't able to choose our advertisers as we simply place the ads on a certain part of the page.

If we do make changes to allow advertisers to place other advertisements on NovaTerra, it will be featured on this same FAQ page.

We can't really answer this question for you. You can choose when and how many times you choose to watch these video ads. We do, however, encourage to not over-watch this advertisements in order to donate. We understand that we all want to do good and it has never been easier, but if too many NovaTerra users do this we could have our partnership with Good Loop terminated. This would cause us to be unable to complete our goal as a community of raising 50,000 pounds by 2020.
<br/> <br/>
We advise against watching more than one Good Loop ad per story you read. I hope this gives you somewhat of an idea of how often or when you should watch these video ads.

NovaTerra just makes a review of your article before it is published to ensure that any information you included is reliable and appropriate for our site. If you wish to update your article, we will need to review it again to ensure that it is still appropriate and if sources are used, that they are trustworthy.Â NovaTerra is a platform to connect readers to creators, but not to take the stories away from the creators. Having control over any content you published also allows you to publish your story on another publishing site such as Medium or a blog you may have created yourself. This are countless benefits to having the stories in the hands of the creators and we want to keep it this way. Thank you for your support, NovaTerra.

  NovaTerra does not have set guidelines for stories as we want our creators to be as free and creative in their writing as possible. Being creators ourselves, we know that stories come in all shapes and sizes. However, we do review every story before it is published to make sure it is appropriate, not spam and any information used is from reliable sources. Don't let this discourage you from making stories, we are not picky with stories, we welcome all genuine stories. What we mainly try to avoid is stories that include misinformation, copyrighted content or stories used as a form of spam or sponsored content. We also only allow advertising inside stories that promote environmentalism (i.e. environmentally-conscious companies or charities).  NovaTerra just wants to be a platform that is open to all creators where the is a positive atmosphere that promotes sustainability and activism.

  On NovaTerra, in order to edit a published story, you will need to first make it a draft. What this does is that if you are in the process of making changes to it, you can it off the main pages and re-publish it once you've made the changes you wish to make.
  <br/> <br/>
  In order to do this you will need to navigate to the profile page by clicking on your profile image on the top-right corner of your screen and click 'profile'. Here you will want to go to your 'published' stories and finding the one you want to edit. You will want to click the 'draft'. This story will now appear under your drafts where you can edit it however much you want. When you are ready to publish this story, click on the 'publish' button on the editor page and we will begin our reviewing process again. All of the likes and comments your story recieied will still be there when you re-publish it.

  Yes. However, there is a limit of 75 words used directly and in all cases, you will need to reference close to the text used, the author of the story as well as NovaTerra. If you wish to use another source of content such as photos or videos, you can use those as well as long as you reference the author of the story as well as NovaTerra. Take into account that this only applies in the case that the story does not belong to you. If you are the creator of this story, you have full rights to publish the entire story anywhere online as mentioned in our other FAQ questions. If this story does not belong to you and you wish to use more than 75 words, you will need to contact the individual author, not NovaTerra. All rights to the story belong to the author and NovaTerra will not help you in getting the rights to use this story. If you cannot find the email address of this author, NovaTerra will not be able to share these details with you either. Sorry for the inconveniences, we just take privacy very seriously!

  If you wish to use less than 75 words from a story, you can use that same text on your site as long as the author and NovaTerra are referenced. If you wish to use a visual such as a video or image, you can use it as well, again, as long as the author and NovaTerra are referenced. If, however, you wish to use a full story, you will need to get the rights to do so from the author. If you cannot find the email address of the author from their profile, please do not contact NovaTerra, we cannot share these details from our creators for privacy reasons.

  On NovaTerra, any story published belongs to the creator that published it. This gives creators like you full rights over the stories you write, letting you remove any story that belongs to you from our site at any point in time. Also, the great thing about having full rights to your stories is that you can publish your story elsewhere online as well. If you wish to reach out to readers on sites like <a href="https://medium.com/" className="link">Medium</a> and if you want to support NovaTerra's goal of raising 50,000 euros by 2020, you can both! This lets you reach as many readers as possible. What creators have also chosen to do is that if they want to get paid for the stories they write and make a difference, they can publish their stories on different sites to achieve either goal.
